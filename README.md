# Integrating Data Exchange and Analysis for Networks (IDEANet)
The IDEANet project (NSF Grant # 2024271) aims to maximize scientific discovery in network science by significantly lowering the analytic and access barriers-to-entry for
researchers. As part of this effort, the `ideanet` package offers a set of integrated modules to securely access, process, analyze, and visualize existing network data using
expert-level analytics while conforming to requirements set by source institutions. Our hope is that this project will increase collaboration on intensive, cross-disciplinary data science questions across the social and behavioral sciences.

`ideanet`â€™s core analytic tools automatically generate node- and system-level measures commonly used in the analysis of sociocentric and egocentric network data. These default computations maximize the ability of entry-level users and non-expert practitioners to employ network measurements in further analyses while making all users less prone to common data analytic errors.

## Sociocentric Data Processing

Users applying `ideanet` to sociocentric data can use the `netwrite` function to generate an extensive set of measures and summaries of their networks, which includes

### Node-Level Measures

- Degree (In, Out, Undirected)
- Closeness Centrality
- Betweenness Centrality
- Bonacich Centrality
- Eigenvector Centrality
- Burt's Hierarchy
- Burt's Constraint
- Burt's Effective Size
- Reachability
- Component Membership (Weak, Strong, Bicomponent)


## Egocentric Data Processing
