# Integrating Data Exchange and Analysis for Networks (IDEANet)
The IDEANet project (NSF Grant # 2024271) aims to maximize scientific discovery in network science by significantly lowering the analytic and access barriers-to-entry for
researchers. As part of this effort, the `ideanet` package offers a set of integrated modules to securely access, process, analyze, and visualize existing network data using
expert-level analytics while conforming to requirements set by source institutions. Our hope is that this project will increase collaboration on
intensive, cross-disciplinary data science questions across the social and behavioral sciences.



DEANetâ€™s core analytic tools automatically generate commonly used
network measures at the both the system and node levels. These default
computations maximize the ability of novice users to employ network
measurements in further analyses while making all users less prone to
common data analytic errors.
