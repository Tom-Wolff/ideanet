\description{
Breiger & Pattison (1986), in their discussion of local role analysis, use a subset of data on
the social relations among Renaissance Florentine families collected by John Padgett
from historical documents. The two relations are business ties (recorded financial ties such as loans,
credits and joint partnerships) and marriage alliances. This dataset has since become a standard for illustrating
role analysis methods and working with networks featuring multiple types of relations.
