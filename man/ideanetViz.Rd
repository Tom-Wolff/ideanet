\title{Interactive GUI for Working with Sociocentric Networks (\code{ideanetViz})}
\usage{
ideanetViz()
}
\description{
\code{ideanetViz} is a Shiny app that presents the output of \code{ideanet}'s workflow for sociocentric data (i.e. \code{\link{netwrite}}) in a clear and accessible GUI. This GUI is convenient for users with limited R experience and is useful for classrooms, workshops, and other educational spaces. It is also useful for experienced users interested in quick exploration of network data. Moreover, \code{ideanetViz} streamlines customization of network visualizations and provides quick access into \code{ideanet}'s more advanced analytic tools for sociocentric networks.

\code{ideanetViz}'s design is centered around a series of tabs lining the top of the app, which are ordered according to a typical workflow for acquiring, processing, exploring, and modeling data.
