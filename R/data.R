#' Goodreau's Faux Mesa High School (Nodelist)
#'
#' This data set (originally found in as a \code{network} object in the \code{\link[ergm:faux.mesa.high]{ergm}} package)
#' represents a simulation of an in-school friendship network. The network is named "Faux Mesa High" because the school
#' community on which it is based is in the rural western US, with a student body that is largely Hispanic and Native American.

#' A data frame with 205 rows and 4 columns:
#' \describe{
#'   \item{id}{Node ID}
#'   \item{grade}{Student grade year}
#'   \item{race}{Student race}
#'   \item{sex}{Student sex}
#'   ...
#' }
#' @source The data set is based upon a model fit to data from one school
#' community from the AddHealth Study, Wave I (Resnick et al., 1997). It was
#' constructed as follows:
#'
#' A vector representing the sex of each student in the school was randomly
#' re-ordered.  The same was done with the students' response to questions on
#' race and grade.  These three attribute vectors were permuted independently.
#' Missing values for each were randomly assigned with weights determined by
#' the size of the attribute classes in the school.
#'
#' The following \code{\link{ergm}} formula was used to fit a model to the
#' original data:
#'
#' \preformatted{ ~ edges + nodefactor("Grade") + nodefactor("Race") +
#' nodefactor("Sex") + nodematch("Grade",diff=TRUE) +
#' nodematch("Race",diff=TRUE) + nodematch("Sex",diff=FALSE) +
#' gwdegree(1.0,fixed=TRUE) + gwesp(1.0,fixed=TRUE) + gwdsp(1.0,fixed=TRUE) }
#'
#' The resulting model fit was then applied to a network with actors possessing
#' the permuted attributes and with the same number of edges as in the original
#' data.
#'
#' The processes for handling missing data and defining the race attribute are
#' described in Hunter, Goodreau & Handcock (2008).

#' Marriage alliances and business relationships between Florentine families during the Italian Renaissance
#'
#' Breiger & Pattison (1986), in their discussion of local role analysis, use a subset of data on
#' the social relations among Renaissance Florentine families collected by John Padgett
#' from historical documents. The two relations are business ties (recorded financial ties such as loans,
#' credits and joint partnerships) and marriage alliances. This dataset has since become a standard for illustrating
#' role analysis methods and working with networks featuring multiple types of relations.
